                Required conventions & gotchas

                Use .payload for all business fields
                Access properties as alias.payload.<field> (e.g., c.payload.name, ctr.payload.amount).

                Keep rows with OPTIONAL MATCH
                Use OPTIONAL MATCH for edges that might be missing to avoid dropping the base node.

                Never filter an OPTIONAL MATCH with WHERE on the optional variable
                A WHERE clause attached to an OPTIONAL MATCH that references the optional variable (e.g., WHERE sc.payload.status = 'open') will drop nulls and effectively turn it into an inner match.
                Do this instead: compute flags in a WITH, then aggregate:

                OPTIONAL MATCH (c)-[:RAISED_CASE]->(sc:SupportCase)
                WITH c, sc, coalesce(sc.payload.status,'') AS sc_status
                WITH c, sc, (sc IS NOT NULL AND sc_status IN ['open','Open','OPEN']) AS is_pending
                WITH c,
                    sum(CASE WHEN is_pending THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS open_cnt,
                    collect(CASE WHEN is_pending THEN { id: sc.payload.id } ELSE NULL END) AS tmp
                WITH c, open_cnt, [x IN tmp WHERE x IS NOT NULL] AS open_cases
                RETURN ...


                RETURN is terminal
                Once you RETURN, the query ends. If you need further processing, use WITH (not RETURN) and keep piping until your single final RETURN.

                Aggregation pattern (AGE-safe)



                Syntax reminders:

                Do NOT use reduce(...).

                Do NOT use list/pattern comprehensions that filter by property access (e.g., [x IN list WHERE x.payload.foo]).

                Instead, compute booleans/derived scalars in a WITH, aggregate with SUM(CASE ...), and build lists with:

                collect(CASE WHEN cond THEN { ... } ELSE NULL END) AS tmp
                WITH [x IN tmp WHERE x IS NOT NULL] AS clean


                Null safety

                Numeric: coalesce(sum(...), 0)

                Scalars: coalesce(field, default)

                Booleans: coalesce(flag, false)

                Case folding
                AGE doesn’t support SQL lower(). Prefer exact string matches when you control casing. If normalization is needed, compute it in a WITH using toLower(field) and compare there (don’t attach it to OPTIONAL MATCH as a WHERE):

                WITH c, sc, toLower(coalesce(sc.payload.status,'')) AS st
                WITH c, sc, (st IN ['open','pending','escalated']) AS is_pending


                Column list must match RETURN
                The number and order of RETURN items must exactly match the AS ( ... ) column list in the SQL wrapper.

                IDs

                Internal node id: id(n)

                Business id: n.payload.id

                Close all blocks

                Close map literals }

                Close the $$ block before AS (...)

                One SQL statement per answer

                If asked for multiple sections (e.g., revenue + cases + opportunities), compute them in one Cypher with proper WITH pipelines and return all requested fields in one row per customer unless a list is explicitly requested.

                Hard “don'ts”

                Do NOT use reduce(...), list/pattern comprehensions with property access in filters, APOC procedures, or SQL functions like lower() inside Cypher.

                Do NOT return a single map while declaring multiple columns (or vice versa).

                Do NOT omit closing braces or ``` or the  $$/AS (...) wrapper. 
                Do NOT add \n or other escape characters.
