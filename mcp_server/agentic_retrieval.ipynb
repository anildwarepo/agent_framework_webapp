For example, if the Universal Share is mounted on a Windows system at C:\\\\mounted\\\\MOUNTED, use the path format /C:/mounted/MOUNTED for the BACKUP path.\n",

      "   nbsetconfig>\n",

      "4. Configure the RMAN_OUTPUT_DIR to specify the directory where RMAN input and output logs are placed locally on the client. For Windows, an example path is:\n",
      "   install_path\\\\oracle\\\\oracle_logs\\\\RMAN\n",
      "\n",
      "   Note that NetBackup does not clean up these log files automatically, so the Oracle user must manage them manually.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Verify the syntax of all directives and check all entries against the file path rules for the clients in the policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Run a set of backups and check the Problems report or the All Log Entries report for any warning messages.\n",

      " To configure a backup policy for Oracle on Linux servers using NetBackup, follow these detailed steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add Backup Selections to the Policy:**\n",
      "   - In the Backup Selections tab, specify the mounted path on the NFS client server and the exported path of the Universal Share using the directive format: `BACKUP X USING Y`. For example: `BACKUP /mounted/MOUNTED USING /shares/EXPORTED`.\n",
      "   - If the Universal Share is mounted on a Windows system, use the format `/C:/mounted/MOUNTED` for the BACKUP path, but for Linux servers, use the standard UNIX path format.\n",
      "   - You can add multiple shares in a policy. To group several shares into one backup job, use the `NEW_STREAM` directive for multistream backup if required.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Configure Oracle Agent Script Paths:**\n",
      "   - Use the appropriate script path for the Oracle agent on Linux. For example, set the `DB_SCRIPT_PATH` using the `nbsetconfig` command:\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "     [root@client26 bin]# ./nbsetconfig\n",
      "     nbsetconfig>DB_SCRIPT_PATH = /Oracle/scripts\n",
      "     nbsetconfig>DB_SCRIPT_PATH = /db/Oracle/scripts/full_backup.sh\n",
      "     nbsetconfig>\n",
      "     <ctrl-D>\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - This sets the path to the Oracle backup scripts that NetBackup will use during the backup process.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Register Authorized Script Locations:**\n",
      "   - NetBackup checks for scripts in the default script location and any authorized locations. For UNIX/Linux, the default authorized script location is `usr/openv/netbackup/ext/db_ext`.\n",
      "   - If your scripts are not in the default location, use `nbsetconfig` to add authorized locations where your Oracle backup scripts reside.\n",
      "   - Ensure scripts are stored and run locally; NetBackup does not allow scripts to run from network or remote locations.\n",
      "   - Example to add authorized script locations on UNIX:\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "     [root@client26 bin]# ./nbsetconfig\n",
      "     nbsetconfig>DB_SCRIPT_PATH = /Oracle/scripts\n",
      "     nbsetconfig>DB_SCRIPT_PATH = /db/Oracle/scripts/full_backup.sh\n",
      "     nbsetconfig>\n",
      "     <ctrl-D>\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Select or Enter the Backup Script in the Policy:**\n",
      "   - In the policy configuration, select or enter the full path of the Oracle backup script in the Script drop-down menu.\n",
      "   - For Oracle policies on UNIX/Linux, you can browse or enter the script path, for example:\n",
      "     `/install_path/netbackup/ext/db_ext/oracle/samples/rman/cold_database_backup.sh`\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Save the Policy:**\n",
      "   - After configuring the backup selections and script paths, click OK to close and save the policy.\n",
      "   - If you want to discard changes, click Cancel.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Differences from Windows Configuration:**\n",
      "- On Windows, paths use drive letters and backslashes, e.g., `C:\\mounted\\MOUNTED` or `c:\\db_scripts` for script paths.\n",
      "- On Linux/UNIX, use standard UNIX path formats with forward slashes, e.g., `/Oracle/scripts`.\n",
      "- The default authorized script location differs: Windows uses `install_path\\netbackup\\dbext`, while UNIX uses `usr/openv/netbackup/ext/db_ext`.\n",
      "- Commands to set script paths are similar but use the appropriate shell or command prompt for the OS.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these steps, you can configure an Oracle backup policy on Linux servers effectively, ensuring that the backup scripts are properly registered and the backup selections are correctly specified for your environment [ref_id:1][ref_id:3][ref_id:5]. \n",

Use nbsetconfig to enter an authorized location where the scripts reside. You can also use bpsetconfig, however this command is only available on the primary or the media server.One recommendation is that scripts should not be world-writable. NetBackup does not allow scripts to run from network or remote locations. All scripts must be stored and run locally. Any script that is created and saved in the NetBackup db_ext (UNIX) or dbext (Windows) location needs to be protected during a NetBackup uninstall.For more information about registering authorized locations and scripts, review the knowledge base article:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thttps://www.veritas.com/content/support/en_US/article.100039639\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Open a command prompt on the client. Use nbsetconfig to enter values for an authorized location. The client privileged user must run these commands.On UNIX:On Windows:Review the NetBackup Command Reference Guide for options, such as reading from a text file and remotely setting clients from a NetBackup server using bpsetconfig. If you have a text file with the script location or authorized locations listed, nbsetconfig or bpsetconfig can read from that text file. An entry of DB_SCRIPT_PATH=none does not allow any script to run on a client.
